# SLRRL: Systematic Literature Review on Reinforcement Learning for Humanoid Robots

This repository contains the dataset and analysis related to a systematic literature review (SLR) on the use of **Reinforcement Learning (RL) in humanoid robotics**. The review covers 39 papers published in major conferences and journals between 2019 and 2024.

## Overview

The goal of this SLR is to investigate the current state of RL applications in humanoid robots, highlighting the most commonly used techniques, simulation platforms, datasets, validation strategies, and research gaps. Key research questions addressed in the review include:

- **RQ1:** What are the main RL techniques applied in humanoid robots?  
- **RQ2:** What are the current challenges in implementing RL in humanoids?  
- **RQ3:** How does RL in humanoids compare to other robotic control approaches in terms of performance and adaptability?  
- **RQ4:** What are the limitations of current RL techniques in humanoid robots?  
- **RQ5:** How can transfer learning be applied to improve the performance of humanoid robots in different tasks?  
- **RQ6:** What metrics are most effective for evaluating the performance of RL systems in humanoid robots?  
- **RQ7:** How can RL approaches be integrated with other artificial intelligence techniques, such as supervised or unsupervised learning?  
- **RQ8:** What are the most promising use cases for humanoid robots utilizing RL in real-world applications?

## Insights

Some key findings from the SLR include:

- The **CMU Motion Capture Database** is the most widely used dataset for human motion imitation.  
- **MuJoCo** is the most common simulation environment, but others like PyBullet, CoppeliaSim, Unity ML, and custom platforms are also employed.  
- About **60% of studies do not report or use standard datasets**, highlighting challenges in reproducibility.  
- There is a fragmentation of approaches and limited standardization in humanoid RL research.  

## Usage

This repository can be used for:

- Meta-analysis of RL techniques in humanoid robotics.  
- Identifying gaps in datasets, benchmarks, and simulation platforms.  
- Guiding future research on RL applications for humanoid robots.
